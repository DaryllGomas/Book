# WebGL Zen Space Loading Fixes

## Problem
The WebGL Zen Space was getting stuck on the "Creating Zen Space..." loading screen, preventing users from seeing the interactive book.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Robust Error Handling

- Added comprehensive error handling throughout the WebGL initialization
- Implemented timeout to prevent indefinite loading (8 seconds)
- Added fallback mechanism to show DOM background if WebGL fails
- Added proper error detection in all critical functions
- Added try/catch blocks to handle unexpected errors

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- Reduced particle count for better performance
- Simplified mandala texture generation (removed complex patterns)
- Reduced texture resolution for better memory usage
- Optimized event listeners with debouncing and throttling
- Simplified rendering of sacred geometry
- Reduced complexity of visual elements
- Added fallbacks for optional features

### 3. Debug Tooling

Added a debug mode (accessible by pressing Alt+D) that provides:
- FPS counter to monitor performance
- Option to switch to wireframe mode
- Button to show WebGL capabilities and limitations
- Easy way to switch to fallback background
- Console logging of initialization steps

### Using Debug Mode

1. If the site gets stuck on loading again, press Alt+D to activate debug mode
2. Check the FPS counter to see if rendering is too slow
3. Click "Show WebGL Info" to check for compatibility issues
4. Use "Switch to Fallback" to force the DOM background if needed

### WebGL Requirements

The WebGL implementation requires:
- WebGL 1.0 support
- Support for vertex and fragment shaders
- Reasonable memory for textures (at least 2048x2048)
- Hardware acceleration is strongly recommended

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Stuck on Loading Screen
- Check browser console for errors (F12 â†’ Console tab)
- Try refreshing the page
- Press Alt+D and click "Switch to Fallback"

### Poor Performance / Low FPS
- Press Alt+D to check FPS
- Try reducing browser window size
- Close other tabs and applications
- Update graphics drivers

### Black Screen / No Visuals
- Check if WebGL is enabled in your browser
- Update your browser to the latest version
- Update graphics drivers
- Try a different browser

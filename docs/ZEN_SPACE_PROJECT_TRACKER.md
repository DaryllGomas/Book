# Zen Space Website Project Tracker

## Project Overview
Building an immersive zen-themed cosmic background for a website using WebGL/Three.js, featuring:
- Interactive 3D space with particles, energy flows, and zen elements
- Mandala and sacred geometry visualizations
- Ambient audio experience with meditation sounds
- Zen quotes that appear and fade

## Completed Features

### Visual Elements
- [x] Initial cosmic background with stars
- [x] Enhanced DOM-based zen elements (subtle mandalas, energy centers, waves)
- [x] Increased visual impact of DOM elements (higher contrast, more visibility)
- [x] WebGL implementation with Three.js
- [x] 3D nebula background with shader-based effects
- [x] Advanced star field with twinkling effect
- [x] Energy streams flowing toward center
- [x] Mandala elements with procedural textures
- [x] Energy centers with chakra colors
- [x] Sacred geometry patterns (Flower of Life, Metatron's Cube)
- [x] Interactive ripple effects on click

### Audio Elements
- [x] Ambient drone background sound
- [x] Meditation bell sounds that play occasionally
- [x] Water drop sounds for atmosphere
- [x] Audio reactivity with interaction sounds

### User Interface
- [x] Audio controls with mute/unmute
- [x] Loading screen
- [x] Yin-Yang balance indicator
- [x] Zen quotes that appear and fade

## In Progress / Next Steps
- [ ] Performance optimization for mobile devices
- [ ] Integration with book interaction
- [ ] Expanded chakra visualization and information
- [ ] Additional sacred geometry patterns
- [ ] More advanced particle effects
- [ ] User preferences for audio/visual intensity

## Technical Debt / Improvements
- [ ] Better fallback for non-WebGL browsers
- [ ] Asset preloading system
- [ ] Dynamic quality settings based on device capability
- [ ] Accessibility considerations
